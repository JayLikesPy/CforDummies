//So uh I decided to learn c++ so here this is. And no This isn't fucking skidded ffs just notes

//when you make a C++ file there will always be a main "function"


int main() // <- Main Function
{
    return 0, //<-- Output 
}

//Remeber when you execute your program it will always call the main function, The return is the output 4

//Here we will try and print "Jay is cool"
#include <iostream>
int main ()
{
    std:: cout<<"jay Is cool\n";
    return o, // The Return is pointless btw but it can stay
}
